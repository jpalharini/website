## ...the blog

"João on X" is a hobby of mine, so there is no set cadency for posts nor a specific subject (that's what the X is there for). Posts will be tagged by categories and, in the future, I'll look for ways to filter them.

- Tech - infosec, Apple, programming, tips & tricks...
- Cars - mainly thoughts about the market in Brazil and sharing my experiences
- Politics - it's rare, but when something gets me started...

## ...me

### Who am I?

I'm 23 and I was born in the countryside of Brazil, more specifically in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (located in the very south), I recently moved to São Paulo, achieving two of my life goals at once:

- Live in a completely different environment, as I moved from years of living in countryside cities;
- Live by myself, after living with my parents for 23 years

I graduated as a Technician in Informatics at [IFSul](http://www.ifsul.edu.br) in 2014 and, since then, I've been pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at [Unisinos](https://unisinos.br). Fun fact: I almost went to Med School when I was 17.

### What I do?

Aside from the aforementioned BS degree, I work at [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br) as a Infrastructure Engineer (more on that and previous roles in my <Career> page).

In the (little) free time, I watch the only TV that matters - YouTube, play some games (I'm casual, don't even bother looking me up in Twitch) and travel, mostly by car, A LOT. My parents still live in the south and sometimes I **prefer** to take the car for the 1,100+ km trip, plus I like going on long-ish drives on the weekends. You can find more about my trips in the <Traveling> section.
