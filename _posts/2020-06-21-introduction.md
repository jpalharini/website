excerpt: Why I started this and what to expect
---

One of my hobbies is to write stuff, but I usually do that to myself and never share with anyone, aside from eventual [tweets](https://twitter.com/jpalharini) or [posts in LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joaopalharini).

Here, my objective is to write about things I come across in my day that interest me and that I feel like sharing my opinion about, so you can expect things about cars, technology and (more often than I wish) politics.

Welcome! And feel free to reach out at anytime.
